# BoardGame
A board game with die roll
The game starts with a prompt to the player to select the number of rows and columns. The game starts at (0, 0) position. The player rolls a die and the marker moves to the new position and marks the cell. Once the marker reaches the end of the row, it moves along the next row but in opposite direction. Every time the marker reaches the end of the board (m, n), it moves back to the start(0, 0). A player wins when any row or column is completely marked.
